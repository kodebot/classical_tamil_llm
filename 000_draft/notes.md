literature review

## things to explore

data collection - low resource languages

few shot learning or more data

try to use LLM to see mapping

data generation try different models - do qualitative study


## Meeting with Dr. Abbas

1. Find the context window of LLaMA 2
2. Contact Balachandran to see if the new model is available


## Notes

1. use correct prompt template for LLAMA

## Steps - Data set preparation
     1. Dataset need to validated and verified by the native speaker (Human)
       a. there is no hallucinated
       b. quality is high
     2. using automatic one like GPT

## Chunking - experiment with different chunking sizes

1. use human feedback to validate the data
2. use GPT to provide rank of the data


## Fine tune - with different models - see if that improves

Golden dataset - 

1. Get questions and ground truth answers - 

## RAGus evaluation library - use it to evaluate the model
    1. Does it support non-English languages?  



## Plots loss

Weights and Biases
Pheonix
LangWatch

## Evaluation

BERT Score
CHRF
Explore all similarity score evaluation metrics
GPT-4 for scoring
Human verification


## Review

### Title

1. Pick a better title (few title)
2. Dataset is novel

### Introduction

1. Citation for Tamil language - wikipedia (why important)
2. Should address the problem being solved - low resource language
3. Tamil models are OK but not good enough
4. Hence what you are doing is important

Avoid butllet points and numbered list

Last paragraph - this work curates new dataset, models are fine-tuned and evaluated

### Related Work

1. add all papers
2. lot more info on important paper
3. why human evaluation
4. why text generation
5. why few shot learning

### Methodology

No need for the figure

3.2 measure the size of the data set in numeer of tokens

Move the augumented dataset to the experiment section or in a subsection

Include 3.3.1 as model hyper parameters and also introduce inference hyper parameters. Also explain why these values like other reseachrs or recommended by library

include performance metrics - include the formula as well

try line graph

check if there is a pattern of unnecessary text
