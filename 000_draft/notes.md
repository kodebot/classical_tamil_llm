# Notes

literature review

## things to explore

data collection - low resource languages

few shot learning or more data

try to use LLM to see mapping

data generation try different models - do qualitative study


## Meeting with Dr. Abbas

1. Find the context window of LLaMA 2
2. Contact Balachandran to see if the new model is available


## Notes

1. use correct prompt template for LLAMA

## Steps - Data set preparation
     1. Dataset need to validated and verified by the native speaker (Human)
       a. there is no hallucinated
       b. quality is high
     2. using automatic one like GPT

## Chunking - experiment with different chunking sizes

1. use human feedback to validate the data
2. use GPT to provide rank of the data


## Fine tune - with different models - see if that improves

Golden dataset - 

1. Get questions and ground truth answers - 

## RAGus evaluation library - use it to evaluate the model
    1. Does it support non-English languages?
